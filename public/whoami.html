WHOAMI

 My girlfriend Míša says:

  - he's heterosexual
  - weighs 76kg and is 176cm high
  - sometimes he leaves things,
    before finishing them
  - he likes to cooperate with other people
  - though sometimes someone pisses him off,
    he's people oriented
  - I think he likes working with people
  - of course there are people who don't fit him,
    but thats seldom  
  - in some matters he's flegmatic, most of all in matters
    that are related to non-work areas
  - when he delves into something, he can devote all his time
    to it, lives it and all his thoughts and dialogues 
    with "normal" people revolve around what he's doing
  - when he learns something, he's not so interested
    in it that much anymore
  - he allways make jokes and sometimes I write them down
    (even after 8 years we've been together)
  - he's tolerant, but he doesn't let other people use him
  - he's truthfull, thats why i fell for him 
  - he likes nature, trips, new foreign ities and good food
  - he supports me even in ares other people don't believe

She adds:
 "Don't forget to write about what you can do with computer, 
  what you did and what you finished and such."

  - languages: Czech, English, JavaScript, Ruby, Mirah

Sal: I think what it would be good 
is if you have somehow sketched how
you envision useDriven to develop...
i.e. what other features / insights 
will be available..

  (UseDriven is the proejct I'm working on)
  


Sal: where can I read a bit more 
  about you... what you like / dislike... 
  what types of problems you like to
  solve... examples of your work..


Sal: but very simply: what types of 
  problem would you like to solve 
  (one you are working on) what are 
  others?

Sal: how do you like to organize your
  work (or not organize it :)

Sal: just simple / honest - really

Sal: what do you know of the Lean 
  Start up Movement? (do you know it?)
  if you could write these down.. in
  just a few sentences... and shoot
  me a note to my mail. I'll read 
  I promise...

Sal: the goal is just to get to know
  you a bit more..


Sal: don't over do it... don't spend too 
  much time on it..
Sal: it's just honest candid as if you and
  I were having a beer at the pub 

Sal: 1. tell me a bit more about you 
Sal: 2. what type of advice are you 
  seeking... from fellow entrepreneurs...
