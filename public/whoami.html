WHOAMI
======

My girlfriend says:

  - he's heterosexual, weighs 76kg and is 176cm high
  - sometimes he thends to leave things before he finishes them
  - he likes to cooperate with other people
  - even if sometimes someone pisses him off, he's people oriented
  - I think he likes working with people
  - of course there are people who don't fit you but thats seldom  
  - in some matters he's flegmatic, most of all in matters that 
    are related to non-work areas
  - when he delves into something, he can devote all his time to it,
    lives it and all his thoughts and dialogues with "normal" people
    revolve around what he's doing
  - when he learns something, he's not so interested in it anymore
  - he allways make jokes and sometimes I write them down
    (even after 8 years we've been together)
  - he's tolerant, but he doesn't let other people use him
  - he's truthfull, thats why i fell for him 
  - he likes nature, trips and new foreign and new cities and good food
  - also he supports me even in ares that other people don't believe

She adds: "Don't forget to write about what you can do with computer, 
  what you did and what you finished and such."

  - I made Chrome extensions <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edhkjecdcakijjmlelnjjiohjmlaikhb">Chromodoro</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oacdicfeceillcdnofggnndfagddibfg">FocusRing</a>,
    which I both use occasionally
  - I also do solo hackathons, one of the more interesting one 
    is <a href="http://jabroulette.appspot.com">JabRoulette</a>, which is chatroulette without video using Jabber

How I learned to program:

  - I started web programming with Delphi, generating my static 
    HTML website out of a database, I used event handlers on buttons.
    I had no idea what objects or methods were.
  - in 2003 I started programming dynamic web pages with PHP
  - when my friend told me that I should try OOP 
    I didn't understand the benefits (I owe you Dave!)
  - after few months I started trying OOP
  - I've read "Pragmatic programmer, from journeyman to master"
    in english and I didn't understand 3 words out of every sentence
    which was frustrating. I loved the book though (thanks @jsuchal!)
  - after finishing PP, I started reading "Domain Driven Design",
    not really understanding the benefits at first. 
    I still didn't understand roughly 3 words out of most sentences.
  - I've read other books like Refactoring, Test Driven Development
    by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler
  - I was introduced to Ruby and Rails (thaks again Dave!)
  - I worked for three months at Skvělý.cz where I learned about 
    being a programmer-employee
  - I came across SOLID principles which finally answered 
    the "riddle of steel" equivalent in OOP for me (thaks uncle Bob!)

Sal: I think what it would be good 
is if you have somehow sketched how
you envision useDriven to develop...
i.e. what other features / insights 
will be available..

  (UseDriven is the proejct I'm working on)
  


Sal: where can I read a bit more 
  about you... what you like / dislike... 
  what types of problems you like to
  solve... examples of your work..


Sal: but very simply: what types of 
  problem would you like to solve 
  (one you are working on) what are 
  others?

Sal: how do you like to organize your
  work (or not organize it :)

Sal: just simple / honest - really

Sal: what do you know of the Lean 
  Start up Movement? (do you know it?)
  if you could write these down.. in
  just a few sentences... and shoot
  me a note to my mail. I'll read 
  I promise...

Sal: the goal is just to get to know
  you a bit more..


Sal: don't over do it... don't spend too 
  much time on it..
Sal: it's just honest candid as if you and
  I were having a beer at the pub 

Sal: 1. tell me a bit more about you 
Sal: 2. what type of advice are you 
  seeking... from fellow entrepreneurs...
