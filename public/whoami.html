WHOAMI
=====

I was asked to answer these questions
and I thought I'd write the answers down in
case I get asked them again.


I once read a book called "The secret of motivation" where the author talks about 4 different types of people.

  +--------------+-------------+
  |              |             |
  |              |             |

  +--------------+-------------+
  |              |             |

Sal: I think what it would be good 
is if you have somehow sketched how
you envision useDriven to develop...
i.e. what other features / insights 
will be available..

  (UseDriven is the proejct I'm working on)
  


Sal: where can I read a bit more 
  about you... what you like / dislike... 
  what types of problems you like to
  solve... examples of your work..


Sal: but very simply: what types of 
  problem would you like to solve 
  (one you are working on) what are 
  others?

Sal: how do you like to organize your
  work (or not organize it :)

Sal: just simple / honest - really

Sal: what do you know of the Lean 
  Start up Movement? (do you know it?)
  if you could write these down.. in
  just a few sentences... and shoot
  me a note to my mail. I'll read 
  I promise...

Sal: the goal is just to get to know
  you a bit more..


Sal: don't over do it... don't spend too 
  much time on it..
Sal: it's just honest candid as if you and
  I were having a beer at the pub 

Sal: 1. tell me a bit more about you 
Sal: 2. what type of advice are you 
  seeking... from fellow entrepreneurs..
