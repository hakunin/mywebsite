WHOAMI
=====

My girlfriend says:

  - he's heterosexual, weighs 76kg and is 176cm high
  <!-- jak se se pro neco nadchne tak je zapálený -->
  - when he gets excited about something, 
  <!-- někdy mám trochu tendence opouštět před koncem -->
  - sometimes he leaves things before he finished them
  <!-- rád spolupracuju s někým, -->
  - he likes to cooperate with other people
  <!-- i kdy mě občas někdo sere-->
  - even if sometimes someone pisses him off, he's people oriented
  <!-- jse orientovaný na lidi -->
  <!-- podle mě rád pracuješ s lidma -->
  - I think he likes working with people
  <!-- samozřejmě že se najde někdo, kdo ti občas nesedne, ale to je málokdy -->
  - of course there are people who don't fit you but thats seldom  
  <!-- v některých věcech jsem flegmatický, hlavně ve věcech, které se týkají v mimo-pracovních oblastí-->
  - in some matter he's flegmatic, most of all in matters that are related to non-work areas
  <!-- když se do něčeho zažeru tak tomu klidně obětuju veškerý čas, že tím žiju a všechny moje myšlenky a rozhovory s normálníma lidma se točí okolo toho, co dělám-->
  - when he delves into something, he can devote all his time to it,
    lives it and all his thoughts and dialogues with "normal" people
    revolve around what he's doing
  - when he learns something, he's not so interested in it anymore
  - he allways make jokes and sometimes I write them down (even after 8 years we've been together)
  <!-- he's tolerant, ale nenechá sebou orat-->
  - he's tolerant, but he doesn't let other people use him
  <!-- říká pravdu, na to mě i ulovil-->
  - he's truthfull, 
  - he likes nature, trips and new foreign and new cities and good food
  <!-- a taky mě podporuješ i ve věcech, kterým ostatní nevěří-->
  - also he supports me even in ares that other people don't believe
  <!-- určitě tam napiš o tom, co umíš na počítači, co jsi dělal, co jsi dotáhl do konce a tak -->

She also says: "Don't forget to write about what you can do with computer, what you did and what you finished and such."



I once read a book called "The secret of motivation" where the author talks about 4 different types of people.

Sal: I think what it would be good 
is if you have somehow sketched how
you envision useDriven to develop...
i.e. what other features / insights 
will be available..

  (UseDriven is the proejct I'm working on)
  


Sal: where can I read a bit more 
  about you... what you like / dislike... 
  what types of problems you like to
  solve... examples of your work..


Sal: but very simply: what types of 
  problem would you like to solve 
  (one you are working on) what are 
  others?

Sal: how do you like to organize your
  work (or not organize it :)

Sal: just simple / honest - really

Sal: what do you know of the Lean 
  Start up Movement? (do you know it?)
  if you could write these down.. in
  just a few sentences... and shoot
  me a note to my mail. I'll read 
  I promise...

Sal: the goal is just to get to know
  you a bit more..


Sal: don't over do it... don't spend too 
  much time on it..
Sal: it's just honest candid as if you and
  I were having a beer at the pub 

Sal: 1. tell me a bit more about you 
Sal: 2. what type of advice are you 
  seeking... from fellow entrepreneurs..
